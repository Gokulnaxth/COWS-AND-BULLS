Got it! Your Cows and Bulls game is played with a 2-digit number, and the player has only 6 moves to guess it.

Here’s a refined description:

Cows and Bulls - 2-Digit Edition
In this number-guessing game, the system selects a secret 2-digit number (both digits are unique). The player has 6 chances to guess the correct number using feedback:

Bull (🐂): A digit is correct and in the correct position.
Cow (🐄): A digit is correct but in the wrong position.
Example:
Secret Number: 42
Guess: 24
Feedback: 2 Cows (Both digits are correct but in the wrong positions).
Next Guess: 42 ✅ (2 Bulls – Correct Guess!)
The game ends when the player either finds the correct number or runs out of 6 moves.

This version adds a time-limited challenge, making it even more exciting and strategic! 🎯🔥
